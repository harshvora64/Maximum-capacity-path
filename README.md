# Optimisation of file transfer through router network

Maximum-capacity-path

Modelling a router network as a multi-edge undirected weighted graph and determining a path with maximum capacity in the network, (where ‘capacity’ is the minimum of all weights of the path edges) - maximum transmittable data size.

Complexity: O(nlogn) in the number of edges in the graph, by modifying Dijkstra’s algorithm for the shortest path.
